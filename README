# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    We set out to analyze the success and failures of previously ran kickstarter campaigns in an attempted effort to replicate their successes and avoid possible failures. We did this by reviewing and structuring the data into tables and visuals so that it would be easily consumed by our stakeholder, Louise. 

### Purpose
    Louise, a playwright, has estimated that her new play will need a budget of $10,000 and is setting out to raise this amount from a kickstarter campaign. Her ask of this analysis, is to identify trends or patterns from other crowdfunding campaigns to help her be more successful with her own. 
## Analysis and Challenges
    My initial obersavtions are that out of the group of crowdfunding campaigns in our data set, the parent category for Theater has the highest volume of campaigns ran out of all of the categories and also the most successful campaigns. It does, however, share the highest count of failed campaigns. This appears to be a popular but saturated category on kickstarter. Louise will inevitably face heavy competition from other Theater campaigns. Plays, as a Subcategory, also make up for 73% of the total Theater campaigns. 

    Our biggest challenge, I believe, has to do with having limited data to support our analysis. We will be able to arrive at some consclusions but this will not be a comprehensive analysis. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    It's very clear based on multiples years of data that the Spring to Summer months are the most successful times of years to launch a successful campaign. Particularly, May and June have produced the best months. I reviewed previous months by year and this is a consistent trend with no outliers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Campaigns with goals of $5k and under tend to perform at the higest rate. They then begin to dip down in their success rate below 60% once above $5k. This trend continues steadliy until the $25k+ mark when the success rate drops significantly down to a 20% success rate. There does seem to be a sweet spot, however, once the goal comes back up to the $35-45k range where there's a high of 67% success. Further analysis would be needed of this.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    As previously stated, our biggest chalenge comes from our limited data that we have to work from. We can provide a limited analysis based on limited data but it is insufficient to base budgeting goals on or to truly determeine what was the cause of the success or failure amongst the different campaigns. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. Spring and Summer will consistently provide the best results and campaigns should always be launched at this time. Especially in May or June if possible. 
    2. There are really no exceptions to this rule. When the data is viewed by individual years, May and June produced the best results consistently.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Louise should be safe with her expectation of funding $10k and could possibly go up to $15k. She would be advised to stay below $20k as her chances of getting funded drop.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - We don't know who the demographics of the audiences are
    - We don't know if there are big name directors or performers of the succesful plays
    - We don't know what marketing efforts went into the different campaigns
    - We don't know the genres of the plays

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Seeing the different years of the launch dates would be helpful if displayed in a line graph to show trends over that span.
